                <p><strong>Babies:</strong> We follow the guidelines of the Academy of Pediatric Dentistry while recommending that you bring your baby in for an initial visit by their first birthday. We will go over how you can get a jump on great oral health for your child, including some common misconceptions and risks that may lead to dental disease!</p>

                <p><strong>Formative Years:</strong> Bi-annual check-ups (every six months) will help us monitor the development and health of your child's teeth. Plus, the more you and your child visit, the more comfortable he or she will be with the dentist.</p>

                <p><strong>Teens:</strong> When kids hit their teens, they often become more concerned with appearance. When they don't love their smile, it can make them feel self-conscious.

            <h1 class="section-title">Pediatric Sedation Dentistry</h1>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Comfortable, Stress-Free Dental Care</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>In addition to hospital dentistry, Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics also provides several in-office sedation options to help your child feel more at ease and receive the care they need. Pediatric Dental Sedation is designed to give your child a more pleasant experience, eliminating fear and anxiety so they can receive treatment and enjoy a healthy smile.</p>

                <h3>Sedation Dentistry For Children</h3>
                <p>Visiting the dentist can be hard for kids – many children experience stress, anxiety and fear during their appointments and struggle to receive the treatment they need. We offer pediatric dental sedation to alleviate their anxiety and fears and help children feel more comfortable. Our ultimate goal is to provide your child with the care they need to maintain a healthy mouth and smile while also giving them a more positive experience in our dental office.</p>

                <h3>Your Child's Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pediatric IV Sedation</strong> - Administered intravenously for deeper sedation during more complex procedures</li>
                    <li><strong>Pediatric Nitrous Oxide Sedation</strong> - Also known as "laughing gas," a mild sedation that helps children relax while remaining conscious</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Our pediatric dentists will discuss your child's oral health and sedation options with you to determine which type of sedation will be most beneficial for them.</p>

                <h3>Your Child's Safety</h3>
                <p>Sedation for children is safe, especially when prepared properly. Our pediatric dentists and team will provide you with detailed instructions so you can prepare your child for their sedation appointment. We will also monitor your child closely during their treatment to ensure he or she remains comfortable and safe.</p>

                <p>Make sure to stay with your child after their appointment – depending on the sedation used, he or she may be groggy and drowsy and will need to be monitored for a few hours until the effects of their sedation treatment wear off.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Pediatric Restorative Dentistry</h1>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Repairing and Restoring Healthy Smiles</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Our teeth — just like the other parts of our bodies — can sometimes get hurt or sick. And when that happens, it is time to see the dentist.</p>

                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we provide several restorative procedures to treat teeth damaged by injury or decay in order to bring back your child's smile and optimal oral health.</p>

                <h3>Pediatric dental restorations may include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dental fillings</li>
                    <li>Dental crowns</li>
                    <li>Nerve therapy (also known as pulpotomy or pulp therapy)</li>
                    <li>Extractions</li>
                    <li>Space maintainers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Restorative dental treatments may require taking an X-ray of the affected area. Your child's dentist may use a local anesthetic to ensure the procedure is painless. She will first apply a topical numbing gel before giving an injection of numbing medicine and will make sure the area is completely numb before getting started.</p>

                <p>While most children tolerate their procedure relatively easily, other children may feel nervous or even a bit frightened. We are happy to discuss ways to help your child feel relaxed and comfortable during their appointment.</p>

                <h3>Dental Fillings</h3>
                <p>Pediatric dental fillings are used to repair cavities, which are small holes in the surface of a tooth where the enamel has eroded away due to a buildup of food bits, bacteria and acid. After removing the decayed part of the tooth, tooth-colored material is used to fill in those holes, making the tooth sound again.</p>

                <h3>Dental Crowns</h3>
                <p>A pediatric dental crown may be recommended for a tooth that has a larger amount of decay or which has been cracked or severely chipped due to injury and cannot support a conventional filling. Our pediatric dentists will remove the decayed area before placing a tooth-shaped crown, which sits on top of and covers the original tooth like a cap to restore its appearance and protect it from any future damage. Pediatric dental crowns can be made in stainless steel or a white material – each has its benefits and limitations, and our dentist will discuss them with you to find the best option for your child's needs.</p>

                <h3>Nerve Therapy (Pulpotomy or Pulp Therapy)</h3>
                <p>When tooth decay, infection or injury has affected the nerve or pulp in the center of the tooth, your child may or may not be experiencing significant tooth pain, and our pediatric dentists may recommend nerve therapy to save the tooth. This procedure — also known as pulpotomy or pulp therapy, and sometimes called a "baby root canal" — cleans out the affected part of the tooth and applies medicine to help heal the tooth. A crown is usually placed during the same appointment. The good news? Your child will likely experience immediate pain relief!</p>

                <h3>Tooth Extractions</h3>
                <p>There are a few reasons why your child's dentist might recommend extracting (or "pulling") a tooth:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extreme cases of tooth decay or severe infection</li>
                    <li>To address spacing problems such as crowding or to prepare for orthodontic treatment</li>
                    <li>Over-retained baby teeth — baby teeth that remain in place after a permanent tooth has begun to erupt</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Space Maintainers</h3>
                <p>If your child loses a baby tooth too soon, the dentist might recommend a space maintainer as a way to keep neighboring teeth in place as your child's smile develops — maintaining the space for the permanent tooth to erupt at the right time.</p>

                <p>A pediatric space maintainer consists of a metal band that wraps around one of the neighboring teeth and attaches to a metal loop designed to hold open the empty space. Think of it like saving the seat beside you on the school bus!</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Children with special needs, chronic illnesses or certain disabilities often experience unique challenges when it comes to oral health care.</p>

                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, our pediatric dentists have advanced training and years of experience understanding and working with children with special needs. We are here to help both you and your child feel comfortable and confident that you are receiving the best care possible.</p>

                <h3>How Might My Child's Disability or Chronic Health Condition Affect Their Oral Health?</h3>
                <p>Children with disabilities and chronic health conditions are more likely to develop dental problems due to a number of physiological and functional factors. This makes regular dental visits a crucial part of your child's health care.</p>

                <p>Some conditions, such as Down Syndrome and other genetic disorders, can affect the age at which teeth erupt in the mouth and can lead to bite problems, as well as malformed, extra or missing teeth. Other conditions, including cerebral palsy, may lead to habitual teeth-grinding, which can damage teeth and break down the coating of protective enamel.</p>

                <p>With some physical and developmental disabilities, the ability to maintain oral health through regular brushing and flossing may be limited. Impaired immune function, connective tissue disorders and medications that contain sugar or cause dry mouth can also contribute to tooth decay and gum disease.</p>

                <p>Patients with chronic conditions such as congenital heart disease may require preventative antibiotics before appointments. Others may need specialized planning before treatments or detailed coordination with another healthcare provider.</p>

                <h3>Our Approach to Special Needs Care</h3>
                <p>Our pediatric dentists and team are prepared to welcome your child and address any physical, emotional or behavioral needs that may arise during a dental appointment. During your first visit, we will get a clear picture of your child's whole health and dental development. We then work with you to create an individualized treatment plan, which may include behavior management techniques, sedation or anesthesia as needed. We are also happy to consult on oral health dental care routines at home.</p>

                <p>All jokes aside, molars — those large, flat teeth in the very back of our mouths — are super important when it comes to chewing our food. And because of their shape and position, they can also be super difficult to keep clean and healthy. In fact, the first molars, which usually appear around the age of 6, are the teeth most likely to get a cavity in a person's lifetime.</p>

                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we often recommend pediatric dental sealants to help keep these teeth cavity-free.</p>

                <p>Molars have a bumpy surface that is great for grinding food — and is also a great hiding place for leftover food bits and cavity-causing bacteria. Brushing and flossing are the best ways to keep teeth healthy, but when it comes to molars, another layer of protection can be a big help.</p>

                <p>Dental sealants are a thin coating made from plastic and other dental materials that is painted onto the chewing surface of the back teeth. The sealants keep out the bits of food, bacteria and acid that lead to cavities. The CDC reports that sealants prevent 80% of cavities on back teeth!</p>

                <p>It is a good idea to seal teeth soon after they emerge, so be sure to talk to our pediatric dentists about sealants around the time that first molars (age 6-7) and second molars (age 12) appear. In some cases, depending on the depth of crevices, baby molars may be candidates for sealants as well.</p>

                <h3>What Can We Expect From A Dental Sealant Procedure?</h3>
                <p>The process to apply a dental sealant is quick and painless. Some young children might find it a bit uncomfortable to hold their mouths open for a long period.</p>

                <p>After the dentist cleans and dries the tooth, they will apply a special gel, which creates a rough surface on the tooth so that the sealant will stick. The dentist will then rinse off the gel and dry the tooth again before painting on the sealant. A special blue light is used to cure, or harden, the sealant.</p>

                <p>Teeth and sealants can be brushed as usual and should be checked at each dental appointment. With proper care, dental sealants can last for several years, offering those molars excellent protection from cavities. To make sure sealants last a long time, it is helpful to avoid sticky foods such as taffy and similar candies.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Fluoride Treatment</h1>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Nature's Cavity-Fighting Superhero</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Did you know that one of the most helpful tools for protecting healthy teeth can be found all around us — in rocks, water and even plants? Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral, and it acts like a cavity-fighting superhero when it comes to your teeth.</p>

                <p>Fluoride can be found in the water we drink — from both municipal and natural sources — and even in some foods such as potatoes, raisins, fruits and seafood. Eating and drinking fluoride can help strengthen your teeth before they even emerge! In fact, the CDC estimates that fluoridated water alone reduces cavities in children by 25%.</p>

                <p>And for teeth you are already using for chewing, chomping and smiling, fluoride from toothpaste, mouthwash and fluoride treatments here at Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics helps to keep those teeth strong and can even reverse early signs of tooth decay.</p>

                <h3>How Can Fluoride Treatment Help Keep My Child's Smile Healthy?</h3>
                <p>Although tap water and toothpaste offer wonderful protection against cavities, most kids still do not get enough fluoride, which means they are still at risk for tooth decay.</p>

                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we offer fluoride treatments during your child's twice-yearly visit that provide extra protection with a concentrated dose of fluoride. These treatments create a temporary layer of cavity-fighting fluoride on the surface of the tooth, where it can help to strengthen tooth enamel and fight against cavity-causing bacteria.</p>

                <p>Fluoride treatment comes in a few different forms. One option is a topical gel, used with or without a special tray. Children should wait at least 30 minutes after treatment to eat or drink anything. Our pediatric dentists also offer a varnish, which is painted onto your child's teeth and hardens quickly when it comes into contact with saliva. Patients should wait 4-6 hours before brushing their teeth.</p>

                <p>Your dentist will discuss fluoride treatment options with you at your child's first visit. Fluoride treatments are recommended for children at least up to age 16, and they can still offer protection for older teens and adults. Both the gel and varnish are quick, painless and available in several yummy flavors — be sure to ask your dentist for your favorite!</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle">Helping Your Baby Thrive</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>If your baby is born with a tongue-tie or a lip-tie, we can help! Our pediatric dentists and team provide frenectomies (a release of these tissues) to help release these ties and ensure your baby can enjoy good oral health and function as he or she grows.</p>

                <h3>What Is a Frenectomy?</h3>
                <p>Tongue- and lip-ties occur when the small connective tissues in the mouth, called frenulums, are too short or thick. These tongue-ties and lip-ties can prevent your child from chewing, swallowing, smiling and speaking properly. In some cases, they may even cause gum recession or gaps between the upper front teeth. A frenectomy, also known as a tongue-tie release or a lip-tie release, is the release of this tethered tissue (under the lip or tongue). This is a simple procedure that facilitates normal oral function.</p>

                <h3>The Tongue-Tie & Lip-Tie Procedure</h3>
                <p>This treatment is quick and comfortable to complete. Our pediatric dentists will first ensure that your child is comfortable, and then swiftly remove the problematic tie. This can be done in just a few minutes, ensuring that your child leaves Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics after just one visit with improved oral health. Sometimes local anesthesia is not even required! We will provide you with detailed instructions and exercises for caring for your child before and after the procedure to help them recover.</p>

                <p>Here at Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we offer Hospital Dentistry to help your child receive the care they need. Our caring pediatric dentists will work closely with you and with the hospital staff and specialists to ensure your child is comfortable and receives treatment without any problems.</p>

                <h3>What Is Hospital Dentistry?</h3>
                <p>Hospital dentistry is recommended when your child's oral health needs require the use of general anesthesia to receive treatment. If your child has special needs, a serious pre-existing medical condition, or extreme difficulty receiving treatment in a routine dental office setting, our pediatric dentists may recommend hospital dentistry as the best and safest option for your child.</p>

                <p>Hospital dentistry is recommended only when it is necessary. Our pediatric dentists will carefully evaluate your child's oral health, medical needs, past experiences and behaviors, and will discuss all possible options with you before making this recommendation.</p>

                <h3>Benefits of Hospital Dentistry</h3>
                <p>There are many benefits to hospital dentistry, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All necessary treatments can be provided in a single visit.</li>
                    <li>A controlled setting in which safe and effective care can be provided.</li>
                    <li>A completely comfortable treatment, as your child sleeps through the entire procedure.</li>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>We started our practice to make dental care fun, friendly and accessible for kids. And while we are excited to see how Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics has grown into a whole-family practice, caring for your child's oral health is where our heart is.</p>

                <p>When your children visit our office in New City, New York, you and they can both feel relaxed knowing that your comfort and care are our priorities.</p>

                <p>Routine dental care is important for patients of all ages! Twice-yearly check-ups and cleanings help us to monitor the health of your child's teeth — and offer an opportunity to become more comfortable visiting the dentist.</p>

                <p>Along with the recommendation by the AAPD, we want to see your child by their first birthday. Starting early is a great way to get a jump on good oral health; it's never too early to start proper preventative dental care.</p>

                <h3>What Happens at My Child's First Visit To The Dentist?</h3>
                <p>The first visit to the dentist is a big step, and we cannot wait to welcome your child!</p>

                <p>At your initial visit, we will provide a tour of our office and an opportunity to meet our friendly team of pediatric dentists and hygienists. We will talk with you to get a clear picture of your child's diet and overall health care and answer any questions you may have.</p>

                <p>Next, we will do a quick exam to assess what is happening with your child's teeth, followed by a gentle cleaning with toothpaste and a fluoride treatment. Both the toothpaste and fluoride come in yummy flavors, so encourage your child to ask for their favorite!</p>

                <p>If your child's dentist wants to further assess any dental health concerns, they may recommend X-rays or a more detailed treatment plan. We are here to answer all of your questions both during your visit and after — call us anytime!</p>

                <p>We know that at 1-year-old many babies don't have more than a couple of teeth. That's okay! Bringing in your baby at this stage for a first dental visit gives you an opportunity to learn how to brush (and floss) your baby's teeth and discuss proper diet and snack choices. So your child is on the way to good oral health right from the start.</p>

                <h3>How Can A Pediatric Dentist Help My Child's Growing Smile?</h3>
                <p>Did you know that pediatric dentists receive specialized training to learn how to best care for young patients? Drs. Hermann, Chaly and Marcovich bring years of experience and expertise in caring for the teeth of babies, children and teens, including patients with special health needs.</p>

                <p>Pediatric dentists not only understand the unique oral health needs of young people, but they also know how to help children feel relaxed and comfortable while receiving dental care, and they can speak to some of the emotional aspects of maintaining a healthy smile that teens and older children might encounter.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Sports Mouth Guards</h1>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Protecting Young Athletes' Smiles</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we know that brushing and flossing are not the only healthy habits in your child's life. Along with eating healthy foods and staying hydrated, physical activity has a huge impact on kids' health and happiness.</p>

                <p>Sports offer lessons in teamwork and problem-solving and boost self-esteem. And, when kids head out to the field or the gym, it can be easy to forget a very important piece of sports gear — a mouth guard!</p>

                <h3>How Can a Mouth Guard Help Keep My Child's Smile Healthy?</h3>
                <p>Almost a third of dental injuries among children occur during athletic activities. And while sports like football, ice hockey, field hockey and lacrosse usually require players to wear mouthguards, injuries can be even more common in sports that do not — think basketball, baseball, skating, biking and gymnastics.</p>

                <p>A mouth guard typically covers the upper teeth and helps to cushion a blow to the face. This protects teeth from being chipped, broken or knocked out. It can also protect softer tissues like the tongue, lips and cheeks. Mouth guards are especially important for athletes who have braces, as they not only protect the brackets and wires, but also create a barrier between the braces and the inside of your cheeks and lips.</p>

                <h3>How Can I Choose the Best Mouth Guard for My Child?</h3>
                <p>Dental injuries from sports often require emergency medical care, and long-term treatment for a damaged tooth can be costly. It is well worth the investment of time and money to find a well-fitting mouth guard that will last.</p>

                <p>While there are many mouth guards available "over-the-counter" at sporting goods stores and pharmacies, these one-size-fits-all options are often bulky and do not fit well. Boil-and-bite mouthguards offer a more fitted option that can be more comfortable and offer better protection, but even these tend to not fit well.</p>

                <p>The BEST choice for an athletic mouth guard is a custom-fitted guard made specifically for your child by a pediatric dentist. Our pediatric dentists here at Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics have the expertise to fit your child or teen for a mouth guard that will provide them with the best protection possible, so they can focus on doing what they love!</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle">Creating Beautiful, Healthy Smiles</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Braces are an incredible tool when it comes to creating a beautiful and healthy smile. Braces are one option for orthodontic treatment that can help correct malocclusions, or "bad bites," especially in young people whose jaws and teeth are still developing.</p>

                <p>Traditional braces gently move teeth into the right position by applying constant pressure. Small metal or ceramic brackets are affixed to the teeth to hold an orthodontic wire, which will be adjusted at appointments throughout the course of treatment. We provide traditional metal braces as well as ceramic and gold braces to meet your needs.</p>

                <p>Braces may be applied to all of the teeth — as in Phase II orthodontic treatment — or just to a few teeth — more common in Phase I treatment. Other appliances, such as rubber bands or headgear, may be recommended to help the braces move the teeth in the right way.</p>

                <h3>What Can I Expect When I Get Braces?</h3>
                <p>Make sure you are up to date on any routine dental visits. About a week before you get braces, your orthodontist may schedule an appointment to place "separators" — small, donut-shaped rubber bands that fit between the back teeth and help make space for the metal bands that will anchor your braces.</p>

                <p>The appointment for applying braces will probably be the longest one you have during the course of treatment — plan on being at our office for about two hours. While you might find such a long appointment a bit uncomfortable, rest assured that getting braces is painless.</p>

                <p>During this appointment, our orthodontist will use an adhesive to attach a bracket to each tooth. Once the adhesive is cured, or hardened, they will thread a wire through the brackets and secure it with tiny O-shaped rubber bands called ligatures. These bands come in many colors — our patients love expressing themselves by choosing favorite combinations or showing off school or team spirit!</p>

                <p>At the end of your appointment, we will explain how to care for your braces — including brushing and flossing and avoiding certain foods and drinks — and we will answer all of your questions about living with braces. Your teeth will likely feel a bit sore for the first few days after you get braces — warm saltwater rinses, cold foods (ice cream, yum!) and over-the-counter pain relievers can all help you feel better.</p>

                <h3>How Do I Take Care of My Braces During Treatment?</h3>
                <p>While the length of orthodontic treatment is different for each person, there are some things that will help all patients successfully find their best smile:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brush and floss regularly, being careful to clean around brackets and between teeth. Ask our orthodontist for tips on reaching difficult spots.</li>
                    <li>Continue to see a dentist every three to six months for routine cleanings and check-ups. During orthodontic treatment it is often a good idea to go for a professional dental cleaning more often.</li>
                    <li>Avoid hard, crunchy or sticky foods like popcorn, caramels, hard candies, carrots, whole apples or nuts. And stay away from sugary drinks and sodas, too.</li>
                    <li>Wear rubber bands as instructed by our orthodontist.</li>
                    <li>Wear a mouthguard when you play sports.</li>
                    <li>Contact our orthodontist right away if a bracket or wire becomes loose.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition, be sure to keep all of your orthodontic appointments at Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics. These short visits allow our orthodontist to check your progress and adjust your braces to be sure you are working toward the best smile possible.</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle">Breaking Bad Oral Habits for Better Development</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>If your child sucks fingers or thumbs or has other negative oral habits, we can help. These types of habits can often cause damage to their oral growth and development, and by correcting these habits early we can also help your child avoid the need for more extensive orthodontic treatment in the future.</p>

                <h3>Thumb & Finger Sucking Habits</h3>
                <p>Thumb and finger sucking is normal in children under the age of 4, and most children will stop on their own between ages 2 and 4. However, if they continue to suck their thumbs or fingers beyond this point it can cause significant damage to the alignment of their teeth and jaw, including problems such as open bites, crossbites and horizontal overlaps of the front teeth, and problems with speech.</p>

                <p>Similarly, constant pressure of the tongue against the teeth (also known as a tongue-thrust) when swallowing, speaking and at rest can force teeth and arches out of alignment.</p>

                <h3>Habit Correction Appliances</h3>
                <p>There are a number of oral appliances our orthodontist may recommend to help break finger sucking and tongue thrusting habits. Thumb sucking appliances are often effective in discouraging sucking, while tongue thrust appliances usually involve a type of "physical therapy" to help retrain the muscles of the tongue. Our pediatric dentists and orthodontist will work closely with you to determine the right option for your children so they can develop better habits and enjoy the benefits of a healthy smile.</p>

                <p>We may also recommend simple things you can try at home to break bad oral habits, such as putting a glove or a sock over your child's hand or creating diversions at times when they usually suck their fingers. They may also suck their fingers due to anxiety and might stop if the source of their anxiety is found and appropriately managed or soothed.</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Dr. Emily Schadt provides treatments to help impacted teeth erupt properly so that children can continue to grow and develop properly as well as maintain correct dental alignment.</p>

                <h3>What Is An Impacted Tooth?</h3>
                <p>An impacted tooth is a tooth which fails to erupt properly, remaining trapped in the gums and bone tissues. The most common teeth to become impacted are the wisdom teeth (third molars) however, the second most common impacted teeth are the canine teeth.</p>

                <h3>Impacted Tooth Exposure</h3>
                <p>If your teeth do not erupt normally, our orthodontist will check the position of the adjacent teeth and take X-rays to determine if the teeth are impacted and assess the effects on the neighboring teeth. We can then create a treatment plan to expose the impacted teeth. Impacted tooth exposure typically involves removing the gums that cover the tooth. In some cases, this is enough to allow the tooth to erupt normally. In other cases, an orthodontic attachment may need to be bonded to the impacted tooth. This attachment is connected to a small chain and will gradually and gently guide your impacted tooth into its proper position.</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle">A Discreet Alternative to Traditional Braces</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>If you are looking for an alternative to traditional braces, our orthodontist may recommend Invisalign® clear aligners. This treatment works to straighten your teeth using a series of clear plastic aligners, offering you a treatment that is effective as well as discreet and comfortable.</p>

                <h3>What Is Invisalign Treatment?</h3>
                <p>Invisalign treatment is a type of orthodontic care that uses specially designed aligners to correct the position of your teeth. Invisalign clear aligners can correct all the same issues as braces, including crowded and crooked teeth, gaps and excessively spaced teeth and bad bites. This treatment is often a great option for adults and teenagers who are interested in a virtually invisible orthodontic treatment option.</p>

                <p>In addition to being more discreet the aligners are also removable, which allows you to brush and floss normally and to eat whatever you would like. We do recommend that you wear your aligners whenever you are not eating, brushing or flossing in order to keep your treatment on track. We also encourage you to clean your aligners regularly, as they can cause your teeth to appear discolored if they are dirty.</p>

                <h3>The Invisalign Treatment Process</h3>
                <p>Your Invisalign treatment begins with a consultation to determine if Invisalign clear aligners are the right option for you. If they are, then our orthodontist will begin by taking digital scans of your teeth from which your aligners will be made. You will wear your aligners for several weeks before switching to a new set of aligners. As you continue to change to new sets of aligners, small adjustments will be made to your teeth until they have been moved into their ideal positions.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Invisalign® Teen</h1>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Clear Aligners Designed for Teens</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we believe everyone has the right to be themselves and to take on the world with courage and confidence! When it comes to our teen and tween patients, we know that creating a great smile can go a long way.</p>

                <p>Invisalign® clear aligners are a great orthodontic option for some teens, especially if they feel self-conscious about traditional braces or want the convenience of being able to eat, drink and brush like normal. Invisalign treatment offers teens consistent results — as long as they put in consistent effort by wearing their clear aligners 20 to 22 hours per day.</p>

                <h3>How Does Invisalign Treatment For Teens Work?</h3>
                <p>Invisalign treatment begins with an initial appointment where our orthodontic team will take a digital scan of your teen's mouth using an iTero Element scanner. The scanner takes 6,000 images per second to create a complete 3D picture of their teeth. Using special computer software, our team will map out the path to your best smile.</p>

                <p>Once your teen's custom-designed aligners arrive, they will wear them daily — for 20 to 22 hours a day — as they gently shift your teen's teeth in the right direction. Every one or two weeks, your teen will change to a new set of aligners, as directed by our orthodontist. The total length of treatment varies from person to person, but your teen will probably start to see subtle changes within the first several weeks.</p>

                <p>To help teens stay on track with their Invisalign treatment, aligners can include a small blue dot that will change colors to indicate if they are being worn as needed. Our orthodontist may also recommend applying SmartForce attachments — small, tooth-colored bumps that act like against which the Invisalign aligners push. For teens and tweens with overbites, precision wings can help to gradually move the lower jaw into place.</p>

                <h3>Invisalign Aligners vs. Braces? Which One Is Right For My Teen?</h3>
                <p>Pursuing orthodontic treatment is a big decision, one that can have an impact on your teen's smile for many years to come. Here are a few ways that Invisalign treatment is different from traditional braces:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Invisalign clear aligners are removable.</strong> While traditional braces are affixed to the surface of the teeth, Invisalign aligners are worn like retainers and can be easily popped out to eat, drink or brush.</li>
                    <li><strong>There are no forbidden foods — bring on the popcorn!</strong> Since you can remove your aligners to eat, no food is "off limits" during treatment — feel free to chew popcorn, apples, carrots or gum. Just make sure to brush and floss your teeth and replace the aligners after you eat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aligners are less irritating.</strong> With Invisalign aligners, there are no brackets to rub against the inside of the mouth — and fewer emergency trips to our orthodontist for broken brackets or poking wires.</li>
                    <li><strong>There are no brackets to brush around.</strong> No tricky nooks and crannies to brush or wires to floss around here! Remove your aligners to brush and floss your teeth — and be sure to give your aligners a gentle brush each day while you are at it.</li>
                </ul>

            <p class="section-subtitle">Widening the Upper Jaw for Better Alignment</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>When you visit our orthodontist for your initial consultation, we will examine your teeth and bite to evaluate the fit of your upper and lower teeth. Many patients need adjustments to their bite in order to help their top and bottom teeth fit together properly and ensure a smile that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. In cases where the upper arch is too narrow and cannot accommodate all your teeth, a palatal expander may be a good option for making this adjustment and improving your bite.</p>

                <h3>What Are Palatal Expanders?</h3>
                <p>Palatal expanders are a type of orthodontic appliance used to widen the upper jaw. Palatal expanders are very gentle, working gradually to address functional issues and create a broader, more aesthetic smile.</p>

                <h3>How Do Palatal Expanders Work?</h3>
                <p>Palatal expanders work by gradually stretching the soft cartilage of middle of the the palate, making room for crowded permanent teeth without the need of extracting those teeth. Our orthodontist will discuss whether or not a palatal expander is right for you, and whether a fixed or removable appliance would be most beneficial for your needs.</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we want you to love your smile!</p>

                <p>We love creating great smiles for patients of all ages, and we offer a variety of orthodontic treatment options — from traditional braces to clear retainers — to fit your oral health needs.</p>

                <h3>Does My Child Need Braces? How Can Orthodontic Treatment Help My Child's Smile?</h3>
                <p>While a bright smile can help us all feel confident, orthodontia is about more than just appearances.</p>

                <p>Malocclusions, or "bad bites" characterized by upper and lower teeth that do not align, can affect the way you chew, speak and smile — and it can even lead to more serious (and expensive) oral health problems later in life.</p>

                <p>Some of the common conditions that can be corrected with orthodontic treatment are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Crowded Teeth:</strong> Teeth that are crooked, rotated or overlapping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Excessive Overjet:</strong> The upper jaw or upper front teeth are much further forward than the lower front teeth or jaw.</li>
                    <li><strong>Underbite:</strong> The lower jaw or teeth are too far forward, or the upper jaw or teeth are too far back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Excessive Overbite:</strong> The upper teeth excessively overlap the bottom ones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protrusion:</strong> The upper teeth stick out and do not fit with the lower front teeth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Excessive Spacing:</strong> Teeth that have wide gaps between them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What is Two-Phase Orthodontic Treatment? When Should My Child See an Orthodontist?</h3>
                <p>We follow the recommendation of the American Academy of Orthodontics, which recommends that you schedule a complimentary consultation for your child with our orthodontist in our New City office as early as age 7. This may seem young — especially if you had braces as an older child yourself — but it is the perfect time to understand if their smile can be treated with one- or two-phase orthodontic treatment approaches.</p>

                <p>Two-phase orthodontic treatment simply means that treatment is done at two separate times — typically before and after all of the patient's permanent teeth emerge. Not everyone who has Phase I treatment will need Phase II treatment, but since the two phases treat different sets of problems, many children benefit from both.</p>

                <p>Here is what to expect from each phase of treatment:</p>

                <h3>Phase I Orthodontic Treatment</h3>
                <p>The first phase of orthodontic treatment is done before all of the permanent teeth erupt because this is the best time to prevent or fix problems of jaw growth and development. Treatment at this time can address the amount of space permanent teeth have to grow into, as well as any conditions that could cause tooth damage if left untreated.</p>

                <p>During this time in a child's development, the upper jawbone is still growing and can be gently guided into proper position. Treatment in Phase I is typically done with an appliance in the mouth or with limited (not full-mouth) braces. After Phase I, our orthodontist may recommend a temporary retainer to maintain the positive changes as the rest of the permanent teeth erupt.</p>

                <p>Our orthodontic team will determine whether Phase II treatment is necessary at a later time. Children who have Phase I treatment often have a shorter Phase II treatment and can sometimes avoid additional procedures such as extractions.</p>

                <h3>Phase II Orthodontic Treatment</h3>
                <p>Once all of the permanent teeth are in place, Phase II treatment can begin to move the teeth into a position that is in harmony with the jaws, lips and other teeth. This is often done with a full set of braces or, for certain cases, with a series of clear aligner trays.</p>

                <p>During this phase, the lower jawbone is growing, which makes Phase II the perfect time to address lower jaw issues such as overbites.</p>
