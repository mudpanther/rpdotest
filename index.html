                <p><strong>Babies:</strong> We follow the guidelines of the Academy of Pediatric Dentistry while recommending that you bring your baby in for an initial visit by their first birthday. We will go over how you can get a jump on great oral health for your child, including some common misconceptions and risks that may lead to dental disease!</p>

                <p><strong>Formative Years:</strong> Bi-annual check-ups (every six months) will help us monitor the development and health of your child's teeth. Plus, the more you and your child visit, the more comfortable he or she will be with the dentist.</p>

                <p><strong>Teens:</strong> When kids hit their teens, they often become more concerned with appearance. When they don't love their smile, it can make them feel self-conscious.

            <p class="section-subtitle">Comfortable, Stress-Free Dental Care</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>In addition to hospital dentistry, Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics also provides several in-office sedation options to help your child feel more at ease and receive the care they need. Pediatric Dental Sedation is designed to give your child a more pleasant experience, eliminating fear and anxiety so they can receive treatment and enjoy a healthy smile.</p>

                <h3>Sedation Dentistry For Children</h3>
                <p>Visiting the dentist can be hard for kids – many children experience stress, anxiety and fear during their appointments and struggle to receive the treatment they need. We offer pediatric dental sedation to alleviate their anxiety and fears and help children feel more comfortable. Our ultimate goal is to provide your child with the care they need to maintain a healthy mouth and smile while also giving them a more positive experience in our dental office.</p>

                <h3>Your Child's Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pediatric IV Sedation</strong> - Administered intravenously for deeper sedation during more complex procedures</li>
                    <li><strong>Pediatric Nitrous Oxide Sedation</strong> - Also known as "laughing gas," a mild sedation that helps children relax while remaining conscious</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Our pediatric dentists will discuss your child's oral health and sedation options with you to determine which type of sedation will be most beneficial for them.</p>

                <h3>Your Child's Safety</h3>
                <p>Sedation for children is safe, especially when prepared properly. Our pediatric dentists and team will provide you with detailed instructions so you can prepare your child for their sedation appointment. We will also monitor your child closely during their treatment to ensure he or she remains comfortable and safe.</p>

                <p>Make sure to stay with your child after their appointment – depending on the sedation used, he or she may be groggy and drowsy and will need to be monitored for a few hours until the effects of their sedation treatment wear off.</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle">Repairing and Restoring Healthy Smiles</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Our teeth — just like the other parts of our bodies — can sometimes get hurt or sick. And when that happens, it is time to see the dentist.</p>

                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we provide several restorative procedures to treat teeth damaged by injury or decay in order to bring back your child's smile and optimal oral health.</p>

                <h3>Pediatric dental restorations may include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dental fillings</li>
                    <li>Dental crowns</li>
                    <li>Nerve therapy (also known as pulpotomy or pulp therapy)</li>
                    <li>Extractions</li>
                    <li>Space maintainers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Restorative dental treatments may require taking an X-ray of the affected area. Your child's dentist may use a local anesthetic to ensure the procedure is painless. She will first apply a topical numbing gel before giving an injection of numbing medicine and will make sure the area is completely numb before getting started.</p>

                <p>While most children tolerate their procedure relatively easily, other children may feel nervous or even a bit frightened. We are happy to discuss ways to help your child feel relaxed and comfortable during their appointment.</p>

                <h3>Dental Fillings</h3>
                <p>Pediatric dental fillings are used to repair cavities, which are small holes in the surface of a tooth where the enamel has eroded away due to a buildup of food bits, bacteria and acid. After removing the decayed part of the tooth, tooth-colored material is used to fill in those holes, making the tooth sound again.</p>

                <h3>Dental Crowns</h3>
                <p>A pediatric dental crown may be recommended for a tooth that has a larger amount of decay or which has been cracked or severely chipped due to injury and cannot support a conventional filling. Our pediatric dentists will remove the decayed area before placing a tooth-shaped crown, which sits on top of and covers the original tooth like a cap to restore its appearance and protect it from any future damage. Pediatric dental crowns can be made in stainless steel or a white material – each has its benefits and limitations, and our dentist will discuss them with you to find the best option for your child's needs.</p>

                <h3>Nerve Therapy (Pulpotomy or Pulp Therapy)</h3>
                <p>When tooth decay, infection or injury has affected the nerve or pulp in the center of the tooth, your child may or may not be experiencing significant tooth pain, and our pediatric dentists may recommend nerve therapy to save the tooth. This procedure — also known as pulpotomy or pulp therapy, and sometimes called a "baby root canal" — cleans out the affected part of the tooth and applies medicine to help heal the tooth. A crown is usually placed during the same appointment. The good news? Your child will likely experience immediate pain relief!</p>

                <h3>Tooth Extractions</h3>
                <p>There are a few reasons why your child's dentist might recommend extracting (or "pulling") a tooth:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extreme cases of tooth decay or severe infection</li>
                    <li>To address spacing problems such as crowding or to prepare for orthodontic treatment</li>
                    <li>Over-retained baby teeth — baby teeth that remain in place after a permanent tooth has begun to erupt</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Space Maintainers</h3>
                <p>If your child loses a baby tooth too soon, the dentist might recommend a space maintainer as a way to keep neighboring teeth in place as your child's smile develops — maintaining the space for the permanent tooth to erupt at the right time.</p>

                <p>A pediatric space maintainer consists of a metal band that wraps around one of the neighboring teeth and attaches to a metal loop designed to hold open the empty space. Think of it like saving the seat beside you on the school bus!</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Children with special needs, chronic illnesses or certain disabilities often experience unique challenges when it comes to oral health care.</p>

                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, our pediatric dentists have advanced training and years of experience understanding and working with children with special needs. We are here to help both you and your child feel comfortable and confident that you are receiving the best care possible.</p>

                <h3>How Might My Child's Disability or Chronic Health Condition Affect Their Oral Health?</h3>
                <p>Children with disabilities and chronic health conditions are more likely to develop dental problems due to a number of physiological and functional factors. This makes regular dental visits a crucial part of your child's health care.</p>

                <p>Some conditions, such as Down Syndrome and other genetic disorders, can affect the age at which teeth erupt in the mouth and can lead to bite problems, as well as malformed, extra or missing teeth. Other conditions, including cerebral palsy, may lead to habitual teeth-grinding, which can damage teeth and break down the coating of protective enamel.</p>

                <p>With some physical and developmental disabilities, the ability to maintain oral health through regular brushing and flossing may be limited. Impaired immune function, connective tissue disorders and medications that contain sugar or cause dry mouth can also contribute to tooth decay and gum disease.</p>

                <p>Patients with chronic conditions such as congenital heart disease may require preventative antibiotics before appointments. Others may need specialized planning before treatments or detailed coordination with another healthcare provider.</p>

                <h3>Our Approach to Special Needs Care</h3>
                <p>Our pediatric dentists and team are prepared to welcome your child and address any physical, emotional or behavioral needs that may arise during a dental appointment. During your first visit, we will get a clear picture of your child's whole health and dental development. We then work with you to create an individualized treatment plan, which may include behavior management techniques, sedation or anesthesia as needed. We are also happy to consult on oral health dental care routines at home.</p>

                <p><em>What did the dentist see at the North Pole? … A molar bear! (Haha!)</em></p>
                
                <p>All jokes aside, molars — those large, flat teeth in the very back of our mouths — are super important when it comes to chewing our food. And because of their shape and position, they can also be super difficult to keep clean and healthy. In fact, the first molars, which usually appear around the age of 6, are the teeth most likely to get a cavity in a person's lifetime.</p>

                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we often recommend pediatric dental sealants to help keep these teeth cavity-free.</p>

                <h3>How Can Dental Sealants Help Keep My Child's Smile Healthy?</h3>
                <p>Molars have a bumpy surface that is great for grinding food — and is also a great hiding place for leftover food bits and cavity-causing bacteria. Brushing and flossing are the best ways to keep teeth healthy, but when it comes to molars, another layer of protection can be a big help.</p>

                <p>Dental sealants are a thin coating made from plastic and other dental materials that is painted onto the chewing surface of the back teeth. The sealants keep out the bits of food, bacteria and acid that lead to cavities. The CDC reports that sealants prevent 80% of cavities on back teeth!</p>

                <p>It is a good idea to seal teeth soon after they emerge, so be sure to talk to our pediatric dentists about sealants around the time that first molars (age 6-7) and second molars (age 12) appear. In some cases, depending on the depth of crevices, baby molars may be candidates for sealants as well.</p>

                <h3>What Can We Expect From A Dental Sealant Procedure?</h3>
                <p>The process to apply a dental sealant is quick and painless. Some young children might find it a bit uncomfortable to hold their mouths open for a long period.</p>

                <p>After the dentist cleans and dries the tooth, they will apply a special gel, which creates a rough surface on the tooth so that the sealant will stick. The dentist will then rinse off the gel and dry the tooth again before painting on the sealant. A special blue light is used to cure, or harden, the sealant.</p>

                <p>Teeth and sealants can be brushed as usual and should be checked at each dental appointment. With proper care, dental sealants can last for several years, offering those molars excellent protection from cavities. To make sure sealants last a long time, it is helpful to avoid sticky foods such as taffy and similar candies.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Fluoride Treatment</h1>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Nature's Cavity-Fighting Superhero</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Did you know that one of the most helpful tools for protecting healthy teeth can be found all around us — in rocks, water and even plants? Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral, and it acts like a cavity-fighting superhero when it comes to your teeth.</p>

                <p>Fluoride can be found in the water we drink — from both municipal and natural sources — and even in some foods such as potatoes, raisins, fruits and seafood. Eating and drinking fluoride can help strengthen your teeth before they even emerge! In fact, the CDC estimates that fluoridated water alone reduces cavities in children by 25%.</p>

                <p>And for teeth you are already using for chewing, chomping and smiling, fluoride from toothpaste, mouthwash and fluoride treatments here at Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics helps to keep those teeth strong and can even reverse early signs of tooth decay.</p>

                <h3>How Can Fluoride Treatment Help Keep My Child's Smile Healthy?</h3>
                <p>Although tap water and toothpaste offer wonderful protection against cavities, most kids still do not get enough fluoride, which means they are still at risk for tooth decay.</p>

                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we offer fluoride treatments during your child's twice-yearly visit that provide extra protection with a concentrated dose of fluoride. These treatments create a temporary layer of cavity-fighting fluoride on the surface of the tooth, where it can help to strengthen tooth enamel and fight against cavity-causing bacteria.</p>

                <p>Fluoride treatment comes in a few different forms. One option is a topical gel, used with or without a special tray. Children should wait at least 30 minutes after treatment to eat or drink anything. Our pediatric dentists also offer a varnish, which is painted onto your child's teeth and hardens quickly when it comes into contact with saliva. Patients should wait 4-6 hours before brushing their teeth.</p>

                <p>Your dentist will discuss fluoride treatment options with you at your child's first visit. Fluoride treatments are recommended for children at least up to age 16, and they can still offer protection for older teens and adults. Both the gel and varnish are quick, painless and available in several yummy flavors — be sure to ask your dentist for your favorite!</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle">Helping Your Baby Thrive</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>If your baby is born with a tongue-tie or a lip-tie, we can help! Our pediatric dentists and team provide frenectomies (a release of these tissues) to help release these ties and ensure your baby can enjoy good oral health and function as he or she grows.</p>

                <h3>What Is a Frenectomy?</h3>
                <p>Tongue- and lip-ties occur when the small connective tissues in the mouth, called frenulums, are too short or thick. These tongue-ties and lip-ties can prevent your child from chewing, swallowing, smiling and speaking properly. In some cases, they may even cause gum recession or gaps between the upper front teeth. A frenectomy, also known as a tongue-tie release or a lip-tie release, is the release of this tethered tissue (under the lip or tongue). This is a simple procedure that facilitates normal oral function.</p>

                <h3>The Tongue-Tie & Lip-Tie Procedure</h3>
                <p>This treatment is quick and comfortable to complete. Our pediatric dentists will first ensure that your child is comfortable, and then swiftly remove the problematic tie. This can be done in just a few minutes, ensuring that your child leaves Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics after just one visit with improved oral health. Sometimes local anesthesia is not even required! We will provide you with detailed instructions and exercises for caring for your child before and after the procedure to help them recover.</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Here at Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we offer Hospital Dentistry to help your child receive the care they need. Our caring pediatric dentists will work closely with you and with the hospital staff and specialists to ensure your child is comfortable and receives treatment without any problems.</p>

                <h3>What Is Hospital Dentistry?</h3>
                <p>Hospital dentistry is recommended when your child's oral health needs require the use of general anesthesia to receive treatment. If your child has special needs, a serious pre-existing medical condition, or extreme difficulty receiving treatment in a routine dental office setting, our pediatric dentists may recommend hospital dentistry as the best and safest option for your child.</p>

                <p>Hospital dentistry is recommended only when it is necessary. Our pediatric dentists will carefully evaluate your child's oral health, medical needs, past experiences and behaviors, and will discuss all possible options with you before making this recommendation.</p>

                <h3>Benefits of Hospital Dentistry</h3>
                <p>There are many benefits to hospital dentistry, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All necessary treatments can be provided in a single visit.</li>
                    <li>A controlled setting in which safe and effective care can be provided.</li>
                    <li>A completely comfortable treatment, as your child sleeps through the entire procedure.</li>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>We started our practice to make dental care fun, friendly and accessible for kids. And while we are excited to see how Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics has grown into a whole-family practice, caring for your child's oral health is where our heart is.</p>

                <p>When your children visit our office in New City, New York, you and they can both feel relaxed knowing that your comfort and care are our priorities.</p>

                <p>Routine dental care is important for patients of all ages! Twice-yearly check-ups and cleanings help us to monitor the health of your child's teeth — and offer an opportunity to become more comfortable visiting the dentist.</p>

                <p>Along with the recommendation by the AAPD, we want to see your child by their first birthday. Starting early is a great way to get a jump on good oral health; it's never too early to start proper preventative dental care.</p>

                <h3>What Happens at My Child's First Visit To The Dentist?</h3>
                <p>The first visit to the dentist is a big step, and we cannot wait to welcome your child!</p>

                <p>At your initial visit, we will provide a tour of our office and an opportunity to meet our friendly team of pediatric dentists and hygienists. We will talk with you to get a clear picture of your child's diet and overall health care and answer any questions you may have.</p>

                <p>Next, we will do a quick exam to assess what is happening with your child's teeth, followed by a gentle cleaning with toothpaste and a fluoride treatment. Both the toothpaste and fluoride come in yummy flavors, so encourage your child to ask for their favorite!</p>

                <p>If your child's dentist wants to further assess any dental health concerns, they may recommend X-rays or a more detailed treatment plan. We are here to answer all of your questions both during your visit and after — call us anytime!</p>

                <p>We know that at 1-year-old many babies don't have more than a couple of teeth. That's okay! Bringing in your baby at this stage for a first dental visit gives you an opportunity to learn how to brush (and floss) your baby's teeth and discuss proper diet and snack choices. So your child is on the way to good oral health right from the start.</p>

                <h3>How Can A Pediatric Dentist Help My Child's Growing Smile?</h3>
                <p>Did you know that pediatric dentists receive specialized training to learn how to best care for young patients? Drs. Hermann, Chaly and Marcovich bring years of experience and expertise in caring for the teeth of babies, children and teens, including patients with special health needs.</p>

                <p>Pediatric dentists not only understand the unique oral health needs of young people, but they also know how to help children feel relaxed and comfortable while receiving dental care, and they can speak to some of the emotional aspects of maintaining a healthy smile that teens and older children might encounter.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Sports Mouth Guards</h1>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Protecting Young Athletes' Smiles</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>At Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics, we know that brushing and flossing are not the only healthy habits in your child's life. Along with eating healthy foods and staying hydrated, physical activity has a huge impact on kids' health and happiness.</p>

                <p>Sports offer lessons in teamwork and problem-solving and boost self-esteem. And, when kids head out to the field or the gym, it can be easy to forget a very important piece of sports gear — a mouth guard!</p>

                <h3>How Can a Mouth Guard Help Keep My Child's Smile Healthy?</h3>
                <p>Almost a third of dental injuries among children occur during athletic activities. And while sports like football, ice hockey, field hockey and lacrosse usually require players to wear mouthguards, injuries can be even more common in sports that do not — think basketball, baseball, skating, biking and gymnastics.</p>

                <p>A mouth guard typically covers the upper teeth and helps to cushion a blow to the face. This protects teeth from being chipped, broken or knocked out. It can also protect softer tissues like the tongue, lips and cheeks. Mouth guards are especially important for athletes who have braces, as they not only protect the brackets and wires, but also create a barrier between the braces and the inside of your cheeks and lips.</p>

                <h3>How Can I Choose the Best Mouth Guard for My Child?</h3>
                <p>Dental injuries from sports often require emergency medical care, and long-term treatment for a damaged tooth can be costly. It is well worth the investment of time and money to find a well-fitting mouth guard that will last.</p>

                <p>While there are many mouth guards available "over-the-counter" at sporting goods stores and pharmacies, these one-size-fits-all options are often bulky and do not fit well. Boil-and-bite mouthguards offer a more fitted option that can be more comfortable and offer better protection, but even these tend to not fit well.</p>

                <p>The BEST choice for an athletic mouth guard is a custom-fitted guard made specifically for your child by a pediatric dentist. Our pediatric dentists here at Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics have the expertise to fit your child or teen for a mouth guard that will provide them with the best protection possible, so they can focus on doing what they love!</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <p>Braces are an incredible tool when it comes to creating a beautiful and healthy smile. Braces are one option for orthodontic treatment that can help correct malocclusions, or "bad bites," especially in young people whose jaws and teeth are still developing.</p>

                <p>Traditional braces gently move teeth into the right position by applying constant pressure. Small metal or ceramic brackets are affixed to the teeth to hold an orthodontic wire, which will be adjusted at appointments throughout the course of treatment. We provide traditional metal braces as well as ceramic and gold braces to meet your needs.</p>

                <p>Braces may be applied to all of the teeth — as in Phase II orthodontic treatment — or just to a few teeth — more common in Phase I treatment. Other appliances, such as rubber bands or headgear, may be recommended to help the braces move the teeth in the right way.</p>

                <h3>What Can I Expect When I Get Braces?</h3>
                <p>Make sure you are up to date on any routine dental visits. About a week before you get braces, your orthodontist may schedule an appointment to place "separators" — small, donut-shaped rubber bands that fit between the back teeth and help make space for the metal bands that will anchor your braces.</p>

                <p>The appointment for applying braces will probably be the longest one you have during the course of treatment — plan on being at our office for about two hours. While you might find such a long appointment a bit uncomfortable, rest assured that getting braces is painless.</p>

                <p>During this appointment, our orthodontist will use an adhesive to attach a bracket to each tooth. Once the adhesive is cured, or hardened, they will thread a wire through the brackets and secure it with tiny O-shaped rubber bands called ligatures. These bands come in many colors — our patients love expressing themselves by choosing favorite combinations or showing off school or team spirit!</p>

                <p>At the end of your appointment, we will explain how to care for your braces — including brushing and flossing and avoiding certain foods and drinks — and we will answer all of your questions about living with braces. Your teeth will likely feel a bit sore for the first few days after you get braces — warm saltwater rinses, cold foods (ice cream, yum!) and over-the-counter pain relievers can all help you feel better.</p>

                <h3>How Do I Take Care of My Braces During Treatment?</h3>
                <p>While the length of orthodontic treatment is different for each person, there are some things that will help all patients successfully find their best smile:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brush and floss regularly, being careful to clean around brackets and between teeth. Ask our orthodontist for tips on reaching difficult spots.</li>
                    <li>Continue to see a dentist every three to six months for routine cleanings and check-ups. During orthodontic treatment it is often a good idea to go for a professional dental cleaning more often.</li>
                    <li>Avoid hard, crunchy or sticky foods like popcorn, caramels, hard candies, carrots, whole apples or nuts. And stay away from sugary drinks and sodas, too.</li>
                    <li>Wear rubber bands as instructed by our orthodontist.</li>
                    <li>Wear a mouthguard when you play sports.</li>
                    <li>Contact our orthodontist right away if a bracket or wire becomes loose.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition, be sure to keep all of your orthodontic appointments at Rockland Pediatric Dental and Orthodontics. These short visits allow our orthodontist to check your progress and adjust your braces to be sure you are working toward the best smile possible.</p>
